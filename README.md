The project is a deep learning-based system for detecting smokers in real-time video streams. It utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, for accurately identifying smokers in the video frames. The implementation of the project also makes use of the OpenCV library for real-time video processing. The system is able to detect smokers with good accuracy in real-time, making it a useful tool for monitoring smoking in public spaces.


First we need to clone official-yolov5 repo, the link is in below
- Official yolov7 repo:  https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
- Also here I use the yolov5-s weight for this project
